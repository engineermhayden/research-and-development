Question: Some one seems to trying to penetrate my DRF Restful API. I am seeing the following in my logs:

WARNING 2024-12-11 15:11:20,692 log 462 138406910756608 Bad Request: /ws/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php
WARNING 2024-12-11 15:11:20,693 basehttp 462 138406910756608 "GET /ws/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php HTTP/1.1" 400 143

It appears that someone is attempting to exploit your API with a request that seems suspicious. Specifically, the request `/ws/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php` is indicative of a common attack vector targeting vulnerabilities related to PHPUnit, a testing framework for PHP.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **PHPUnit Vulnerability**: The URL path `phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php` is associated with PHPUnit's older versions, particularly those vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) through the `eval-stdin.php` script. Attackers might be using this path to try and execute arbitrary PHP code on your server.

2. **Bad Request**: Your server is responding with a `400 Bad Request`, which suggests that it recognizes the request as malformed or potentially malicious, and it's rejecting it. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the attack is fully blockedâ€”some attacks might still get through depending on server configurations.

3. **API Penetration Attempt**: The attacker might be scanning your server for vulnerabilities, specifically targeting endpoints related to well-known PHP testing tools (like PHPUnit). These tools sometimes get exposed unintentionally in production environments, providing an easy vector for exploitation.

### Steps to Protect Your API:
1. **Block Suspicious Paths**: Ensure that no development tools, such as PHPUnit, are exposed in your production environment. This includes blocking access to paths like `/ws/vendor/phpunit/` and other similar patterns.

2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Consider using a WAF to automatically block known attack signatures. This could help block malicious requests more effectively and at an earlier stage.

3. **Keep Libraries Updated**: Make sure that all your dependencies (including those related to PHP and any related tools) are up-to-date, as old versions might be susceptible to known vulnerabilities.

4. **Examine Server Configuration**: Verify that sensitive files such as PHPUnit or other testing libraries are not accidentally included in your production server. Use `.htaccess` or equivalent web server rules to prevent access to these files.

5. **Log Monitoring and Alerts**: Continue monitoring logs for suspicious activity. Set up alerts if you notice patterns or repetitive failed attempts from specific IPs.

6. **Rate Limiting and IP Blocking**: If you notice repeated attack attempts from the same IP or range of IPs, consider temporarily blocking those IPs or applying rate limiting to mitigate potential brute force or DDoS attempts.

7. **Security Audits**: Conduct a thorough security audit of your application and API to ensure there are no other exposed vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a similar manner.

This type of request should be treated as an indication that someone is scanning your server for potential weak points. Stay vigilant and ensure your security measures are up-to-date.
