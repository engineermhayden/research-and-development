analyze the coding best practices provided while respecting the file structure information.

Summary of Key Points:

File Organization:
Files should be small and focused
Large files need to be modularized
Each file should have a single responsibility
Common logic should be in utility files
Analysis:

These best practices align with well-established software engineering principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

The guideline "Each file should have a single, clear responsibility" directly implements SRP
This makes code more maintainable and easier to test
Code Reusability:

The recommendation to "Extract reusable logic into separate utility files" promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Utility files make common functionality available across the project
Maintainability:

Small, focused files are easier to understand and maintain
Breaking down large files reduces complexity
Modular code is easier to test and debug
File System Context:

I notice there's a hidden configuration file at /home/project/.bolt/config.json
This suggests a Bolt project structure, which is relevant for implementing these practices
Recommendations:

For Implementation:


src/
  utils/         # Utility functions
  components/    # Individual components
  modules/       # Larger feature modules
  config/        # Configuration files
For File Sizing:

Aim for files under 200-300 lines of code
If a file grows larger, consider splitting it
Use meaningful file names that reflect their single responsibility
For Module Organization:

Group related files in directories
Use index files to expose public interfaces
Keep implementation details private
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide specific examples for implementation?
